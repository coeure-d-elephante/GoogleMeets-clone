# GoogleMeets-clone
This was intially a take home project from one of the companies I was interviewing with. 
However, I got to attached to the project and had a lot of fun building and learning WebRTC framework that I've decided to continue on the project and make it entirely my own. The foundation of the code is by WelcomeWare, however the modularised features, the customisation of the Material UI, are my doing. 

Enjoy!
